# üéÅShop

Shop is an example e-commerce app with a modern architecture and view layout implementation. It's made to showcase the following things (some of which are still in progress):

- A complex e-commerce (network client-focused) app with both SwiftUI and UIKit
- A highly dynamic and backend-driven home screen that's almost entirely customizable through the server
- Migration piecemeal from UIKit to SwiftUI
- A variety of architectures common to iOS apps with a particular focus on SwiftUI-friendly ones
- Testing with Combine and SwiftUI
- Dynamic type and other accessibility features
- Localization and formatters

## Starting the example server

I made a simple Node.js app to run on localhost so the app can use actual network requests. Follow the instructions below to get it running on your environment.

```sh
$ sudo vim /etc/hosts
# Add this: 127.0.0.1	localhost
$ npm install # Install npm and node if not installed
$ node app.js
```

## Architectures

Though by no means fully correct or complete, here are the commits where I tried out a bunch of common architectures before settling on The Composable Architecture (TCA).

## Contributing

This app is my personal playground to experiment with new APIs, but feel free to contibute!
